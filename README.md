# COMPSCI9001 Introduction to GNU/Linux

This one week course happens at the start of Level 3 (third year) for Computing Science undergraduates at the [University of Glasgow](https://www.gla.ac.uk). For many students, it's a 'baptism of fire' - a first exposure to a new and unfamiliar Operating System.

The course learning objectives are:

* to introduce Linux as a platform for software development
* to guve experience in using command-line tools and shell scripts
* to encourage a critical appraisal of OS design and implementation decisions 

The course is structured as a single introductory lecture to motivate the need for Linux and give some historical background. This is followed by a series of self-directed practical labs, one tutorial sheet per lab, introducing various basic concepts in a step-by-step manner.
