{\Large \textsf{\textbf{Unix Tutorial 1: Files in Linux}}}

\bigskip


Log in to your Unix system with your username and password, then
open a bash shell. On the Glasgow Linux setup, you should execute command \texttt{gnome-terminal} or \texttt{xterm} to start a bash shell in a window. On a Mac machine, you should execute the \texttt{Terminal} application.

Type a simple command, e.g.\
\begin{lstlisting}[style=BashInputStyle]
    $ date
\end{lstlisting}
% $
Press Enter after typing in \lstinline{date}. The system should print out the current date and time.
Try a few more simple commands \ldots
\begin{lstlisting}[style=BashInputStyle]
    $ hostname
    $ whoami
\end{lstlisting}
% $

and observe the output.
To quit your bash session, either type \lstinline{exit} or press
\keys{\ctrl + D} together.




Now we are going to practise file manipulations. The special directory \~{} is your home directory, and / is the root directory. Try this:


\begin{lstlisting}[style=BashInputStyle]
    $ cd /
    $ ls
    $ cd ~
    $ ls
\end{lstlisting}

Now we are going to create some files. We will use the cat command to write a string of characters into plaintext files.

\begin{lstlisting}[style=BashInputStyle]
    $ cat > a.txt
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
\end{lstlisting}
% $

You will need to press Enter then \keys{\ctrl + D} after typing the sentence. Here, \keys{\ctrl + D} means `end of file'.

You can run ls again, to show that file a.txt is now in your home directory. Execute some more commands:

\begin{lstlisting}[style=BashInputStyle]
    $ cp a.txt b.txt
    $ ls
    $ mv a.txt fox.txt
    $ cp fox.txt f.txt
\end{lstlisting}

Now we want to create a new directory and move all the files into this directory.

\begin{lstlisting}[style=BashInputStyle]
    $ mkdir tutorial1
    $ ls
    $ mv *.txt tutorial1/
    $ cd tutorial1/
    $ ls
    $ cd ..
\end{lstlisting}

Now suppose we want to save this directory as a compressed zip archive called files.zip.

\begin{lstlisting}[style=BashInputStyle]
    $ cd ~
    $ zip -r files.zip tutorial1 
    $ ls -lh    
\end{lstlisting}
% $

The zip file has been created in your home directory. It should only be a few bytes in size. Now let's delete the original files and directory that we created.

\begin{lstlisting}[style=BashInputStyle]
    $ cd tutorial1
    $ rm *.txt
    $ cd ..
    $ rmdir tutorial1  
\end{lstlisting}


If you try to execute the rmdir command when the directory is not empty, it will fail and give you an error message. However there is a quicker way to delete a directory and all its contents. Try this:

\begin{lstlisting}[style=BashInputStyle]
    $ unzip files.zip
\end{lstlisting}
% $

to restore the tutorial1 directory and its contents. Use the cd and ls commands to check the files are all present. Now, to delete the tutorial1 directory in one go:

\begin{lstlisting}[style=BashInputStyle]
    $ cd ~
    $ rm -r -f tutorial1
\end{lstlisting}

The r flag stands for `recursive' and f for `force'. Use this command with caution! In his book \textit{Creativity Inc.}, Ed Catmull describes how most of the graphics from \textit{Toy Story 2} were wiped from Pixar's filestore by careless use of the rm command. Google for \texttt{rm toy story 2} to find out the details.


\section*{Further Reading}

For further investigation today, use the man command to find out 
the flags for all the commands you have already executed.
Find out how the cat command works in more detail---you can use cat both to print out existing text files, to create new ones and to append to existing files. e.g.\ see \url{https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/3/html/Step_by_Step_Guide/s1-navigating-usingcat.html} for more details.

There are plenty of other file handling tutorials online, e.g.\ see \url{http://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/filemanipulation.php}.
